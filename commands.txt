To deploy using ansible playbook, the keypair needs to be created at first
The name of the created keypair is needed in the terraform config file


To destroy all provisioned resources using terraform:
terraform destroy

terraform init -upgrade # to initialize terraform
terraform plan # to see the resources that will be created
terraform apply # start provisioning resources


# ansible commands
ansible-playbook -i ini_file_path path_of_yml_file


# packer commands
packer validate base_image.json # to validate the json file
packer build -var "infra_env=staging" base_image.json # to start building the image
